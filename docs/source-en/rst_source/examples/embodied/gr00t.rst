This example provides a complete guide to fine-tune GR00T models with reinforcement learning in the **LIBERO** environment using the **RLinf** framework. It covers the entire process—from environment setup and core algorithm design to training configuration, evaluation, and visualization—along with reproducible commands and configuration snippets.

.. note::

   RLinf supports both GR00T-N1.5 and GR00T-N1.6. N1.6 has significant upgrades in model architecture (Flow-Matching Action Head), distributed training (FSDP), and cross-embodiment generalization. Version-specific differences are marked with **N1.5** / **N1.6** labels.

Environment
-----------

**LIBERO Environment**

- **Environment**: LIBERO simulation benchmark built on top of *robosuite* (MuJoCo).
- **Task**: Command a 7-DoF robotic arm to perform a variety of household manipulation skills (pick-and-place, stacking, opening drawers, spatial rearrangement).

**N1.5:**

- **Observation**: RGB images (typical resolutions 128 × 128 or 224 × 224) captured by off-screen cameras placed around the workspace.
- **Action Space**: 7-dimensional continuous actions — 3D end-effector position control (x, y, z), 3D rotation control (roll, pitch, yaw), gripper control (open / close).

**N1.6:**

- **Observation**: RGB images (typical resolutions 128×128, 224×224, or 256×256) captured by off-screen cameras placed around the workspace.
- **Action Space**: 7-dimensional continuous actions. *Note: GR00T-N1.6 zero-pads these 7-dim actions to a 128-dim cross-embodiment universal action space via embodiment tags.*

**Task Description Format**

GR00T directly uses the environment-provided natural-language task description as the language model input.

**N1.5:**

**Data Structure**

- **Images**: Main-view and wrist-view RGB tensors, respectively named as "main_images" and "wrist_images" with shape ``[batch_size, 224, 224, 3]``
- **States**: End-effector position, orientation, and gripper state
- **Task Descriptions**: Natural-language instructions
- **Rewards**: Sparse success/failure rewards

**N1.6:**

**Data Structure**

- **Images**: Continuous RGB video frames from the main view and wrist view, typically named ``main_images`` and ``wrist_images``. Considering timestep history, the shape is usually ``[batch_size, seq_len, 224, 224, 3]``.
- **State**: End-effector position, pose, and gripper state (concatenated with visual features at the network bottom as state representation).
- **Task Description**: Natural-language instructions.
- **Rewards**: Sparse rewards for PPO reinforcement (1 for success, 0 for failure).

Algorithm
---------

**Core Algorithm Components**

1. **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**

   - Advantage estimation using GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation)
   - Policy clipping with ratio limits
   - Value function clipping
   - Entropy regularization

GR00T Core Design Concepts
-----------------------------

**N1.5:**

**1. Modality Config**

Modality Config is a critical design feature in GR00T-N1.5.
By defining a unified dataset interface, it enables different robot configurations to utilize the same dataset. For example, a dual-arm dataset can be used to train a single-arm model through this innovative design.

**1.1 Enhanced LeRobot Dataset**

The LeRobot dataset contains a ``meta`` folder that records all dataset metadata.
GR00T-N1.5 further defines a ``modality.json`` file to determine the data interface of the dataset.

**1.2 DataConfig Class**

GR00T-N1.5 introduces the ``DataConfig`` class to describe all information needed for model training.
It decouples datasets from robot configurations, enabling model training across different robots without modifying data processing code.

**1.3 Embodiment Tag**

The Embodiment Tag is an enum value that determines which ``DataConfig`` to use during training. The model also adopts different state and action encoders/decoders based on this tag.

**2. Fine-Tuning Guide**

Based on the above design, before deploying GR00T-N1.5 in new environments beyond LIBERO, users need to fine-tune it.
The fine-tuning guide can be found at `GR00T official repo's getting_started/finetune_new_embodiment.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T/blob/main/getting_started/finetune_new_embodiment.md>`_.

After fine-tuning, GR00T-N1.5 generates an ``experiment_cfg/metadata.json`` file containing all modality configs and fine-tuned dataset statistics.
This file is essential for GR00T-N1.5 inference and RL post-training.
For more details, see `GR00T official repo's getting_started/GR00T_inference.ipynb <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T/blob/main/getting_started/GR00T_inference.ipynb>`__.

**N1.6:**

**1. Two-Stage Decoupled Training Paradigm**

RLinf adopts a highly decoupled two-stage training architecture for GR00T-N1.6:

- **Stage 1 (Pure SFT)**: Uses ``Pure SFT Model`` mode. The model is completely detached from the physical simulation environment, relying solely on offline expert datasets for supervised fine-tuning.
- **Stage 2 (PPO RL Alignment)**: Based on SFT convergence, loads the model into a FSDP-based distributed Actor for real-time interaction with the simulation environment.

**2. Head-Only Fine-Tuning**

To save memory while preventing "catastrophic forgetting", the framework adopts a backbone-freezing strategy:

- **Backbone Freezing**: Vision-language backbone parameters are strictly locked (``requires_grad=False``).
- **Action Head Focus**: Only the action output head participates in gradient updates.

**3. Flow-Matching Action Generation**

- The model generates high-frequency action chunks directly in continuous space through noise-adding and denoising flow-matching mechanisms (Flow-SDE / Diffusion).
- Key configurations: ``num_action_chunks`` controls prediction step length, ``denoising_steps`` controls denoising depth.

**4. Cross-Embodiment Generalization**

- **Embodiment Tag**: Through configuration tags (e.g., ``ROBOCASA_PANDA_OMRON``), the system dynamically adapts the corresponding state encoder and action space. Both single-arm manipulators and quadruped robots can reuse the same architecture.

**5. FSDP Distributed Parallel Architecture**

- The underlying system has been restructured for the Actor node (``EmbodiedFSDPActor``), which shards model weights, gradients, and optimizer states across GPU nodes.
- Given the significant increase in GR00T-N1.6 parameter scale, the Actor node has been fully restructured to break through the single-GPU memory bottleneck of traditional DDP.

After fine-tuning, the system generates ``metadata.json`` and other statistical files in the output directory, preserving key modality information for inference and deployment.

Running Scripts
---------------

**1. Key Cluster Configuration**

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env,rollout,actor: all

You can configure the placement to share all GPUs among env, rollout, and actor components.

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env: 0-3
         rollout: 4-7
         actor: 0-7

   rollout:
      pipeline_stage_num: 2

You can flexibly configure GPU counts for env, rollout, and actor components, and enable pipelining between rollout and env via ``pipeline_stage_num``.

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env: 0-1
         rollout: 2-5
         actor: 6-7

You can also fully separate components, each using dedicated GPUs without offloading.

--------------

**2. Key Model Parameters**

**N1.5:**

.. code:: yaml

   model:
      num_action_chunks: 5
      denoising_steps: 4
      rl_head_config:
        noise_method: "flow_sde"
        noise_level: 0.5
        disable_dropout: True

You can adjust ``noise_level`` and ``denoising_steps`` to control noise intensity and flow-matching steps.
``num_action_chunks`` determines the number of future steps to use for forward simulation.
GR00T-N1.5's action head contains dropout layers that interfere with log-probability calculations, so ``disable_dropout`` must be set to True to replace them with identity layers.
Use ``noise_method`` to select different noise injection methods. Two options are available:
`flow-sde <https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05470>`__ and
`flow-noise <https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22094>`__.
